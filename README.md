# Amazon E-commerce Clone

Amazon E-commerce Clone is a project that replicates key pages and functionality of a simplified Amazon website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This clone focuses on UI structure, responsiveness, and layout of essential e-commerce screens including Order History, Checkout, and Tracking pages

# Project Purpose
The main goal of this project was to improve my JavaScript skills by applying them in a real-world e-commerce simulation
This project was developed as part of the JavaScript course by @SuperSimpleDev on YouTube, where I focused on learning JavaScript from the basics to advanced skills

Another objective of this project was to keep improving my English proficiency by taking contact with technical content and writing code in English

# Features

Three core pages with realistic UI:
- Home / Index
- Checkout
- Orders
- Tracking

# Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Jasmine Framework for Unit Testing
- Git & GitHub

# Main Concepts Practiced
### JavaScript Practice
This project was built almost entirely using JavaScript, with most of the application logic, rendering, and interactivity handled directly through JS

Main JavaScript practices included:

- HTTP Requests using ```fetch()```
- Request Methods (```GET```, ```POST```)
- Asynchronous Operations with ```async / await``` and ```try / catch```
- Promises and Multiple Promises Handling (```Promise.all```)
- Array Methods (```map```, ```filter```, ```reduce```)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with JavaScript Classes
- DOM Manipulation and Dynamic Rendering
- URL Parameters
- ES6 Modules
- Writing clean, modular, and testable code

<br>

### MVC Architecture

This project was developed following the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architectural pattern

- Model → Responsible for handling data
- View → HTML structure and dynamic rendering in the browser
- Controller → JavaScript logic that connects the data (Model) to the UI (View)

<br>

### Unit Testing with Jasmine Framework

This project includes unit tests written with Jasmine to validate logic and increase code reliability

During tests development, I practiced:
- Test Suites with ```describe()```
- Individual Test Cases with ```it()```
- Assertions with ```expect()```
- Jasmine Hooks (```beforeEach()```, ```afterEach()```, ```beforeAll()```, ```afterAll()```)
- Spies with ```spyOn()```

# How to Run the Project Locally

3- Open ```index.html``` file in your web browser to run the project

4- Open ```tests/tests.html``` file in your web browser to run Jasmine tests
